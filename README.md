*what if we could harness the creativity of LLMs by identifying and building upon only their very best ideas?*

An LLM contains a compressed knowledge of entire humanity, It must be a perfect mate to brainstorm new ideas with! I created this project for fun during a particularly boring time in life. The idea is very simple.
This is a collaborative brainstorming board, where people can share different ideas by adding post-it notes on it. Behind the scenes, an LLM will absorb human ideas and produce new ones directly as post-it notes.
 


## Start to brainstorm now
Add the openai key in the env.template file, and rename It as .env.

Then simply run 
```shell
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The UI will be visibile on the browser at localhost:5000
